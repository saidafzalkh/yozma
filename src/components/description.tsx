        <strong>Yozma</strong> is my personal web blog, a space where I share my
        thoughts, ideas, and discoveries. The name Yozma, an Uzbek word,
        reflects my passion for writing and expression. Here, you&apos;ll find
        posts about philosophy, books, technology, and personal
        insightsâ€”everything that fuels my curiosity and learning journey.
