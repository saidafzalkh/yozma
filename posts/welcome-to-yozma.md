# Welcome to Yozma - A Simple and Automated Blog Platform

Yozma is a minimalist blogging platform designed to be fast, automated, and easy to use. It leverages **Next.js (Static Export Mode)**, **Markdown**, and **GitHub Pages** to provide a seamless blogging experience without the need for complex backend management.

## How Yozma Works

1. **Write in Markdown**: Each blog post is a simple `.md` file stored in the `posts` folder.
2. **Automatic Deployment**: When a new Markdown file is pushed to the repository, **GitHub Actions** triggers an automated deployment.
3. **Static Site Generation**: Using **Next.js 15 (App Router)** in **Static Export Mode**, the blog is pre-rendered for optimal performance.
4. **Hosting with GitHub Pages**: The statically generated site is served for free using **GitHub Pages**.
5. **Beautiful Typography**: Styled with **Tailwind CSS Typography**, ensuring a clean and readable design.
6. **Telegram Instant View**: Supports **Telegram Instant View**, making posts instantly readable within Telegram.

## Why Yozma?

- **No database** – Purely static content means no backend maintenance.
- **Version-controlled** – Blog content is managed directly via **GitHub**, ensuring easy collaboration and history tracking.
- **Fast and SEO-friendly** – Static export provides excellent speed and performance.
- **Automated workflow** – No manual deployment; push your post, and it's live!

Yozma is perfect for developers and writers who want a simple, efficient, and automated blogging experience. Stay tuned for updates and improvements!
